# image_classifier
Image Classifier Project from Data Scientist Nanodegree from Udacity

# Part 1: Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning
In this first part of the project, you'll work through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch. You can access to this with the following link:

# Part 2:  Building the command line application
Now that you've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, it's time to convert it into an application that others can use. Your application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line.
